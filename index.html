<h1>
40th British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science<br> University of Bath, April 4&ndash;5 2024
</h1>

  <p>
The <a href="https://www.bctcs.ac.uk/">British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science</a> (BCTCS) is an annual event for UK-based researchers in theoretical computer science. A central aspect of BCTCS is the training of PhD students, providing an environment for students to gain experience in presenting their work, to broaden their outlook on the subject, and to benefit from contact with established researchers. The scope of the colloquium includes all aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata theory, algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types, languages and logics.

<p>
We invite 30 minute contributed talks on any topic in the scope of the colloquium. <i>Presentations from research students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged.</i> 
</p>

<p>
To propose a talk, please submit your title and abstract by email to <a href="mailto:trjp20@bath.ac.uk">trjp20@bath.ac.uk</a>. We put no restrictions on the originality or publication status of submissions. There will be no formal proceedings but the collection of the contributed abstracts will appear in the Bulletin of the EATCS.

<p>
A small number of travel bursaries of up to £150 will be available. These are aimed at PhD students who do not have alternative sources of funding. To apply for a bursary, please contact <a href="mailto:trjp20@bath.ac.uk">trjp20@bath.ac.uk</a>.
</p>

Bursaries will be awarded on a first-come first-served basis. Applications should be made before the deadline for abstract submission.
</p>

<p>
These bursaries have been made available through generous sponsorship from <!--the <a href="https://www.bctcs.ac.uk/">BCTCS</a> and--> the <a href="https://www.blc-logic.org/">British Logic Colloquium</a>.

Programme
</h2>

<p>
BCTCS will take place on 4 April and the morning of 5 April, and followed by the Southern and Midlands Logic Seminar on the afternoon of 5 April. Registered participants of BCTCS are free to attend SMLS at no extra charge.
</p>

<p>
We anticipate arrivals from 10:30 on 4 April, which should make it possible for participants from the South-West and London to travel up on the first day without needing overnight accommodation on 3 April.
</p>

<p>
A detailed programme will be announced in due course. 
</p>

<h2>
Travel and accommodation
</h2>

<p>
The main campus of the University of Bath is located on a hilltop just outside the city centre. It is within walking distance from Bath Spa train station in principle, but you should allow 30&ndash;40 minutes and be wary that the route involves a steep uphill climb. A more comfortable alternative is to take one of the regular bus connections from the city centre to the campus. Further information on how to get to the university can be found <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/topics/travel-advice/">here</a>, with details of bus routes <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/travelling-by-bus-to-the-university-of-bath/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Talks will take place in the Chancellors' Building room 1.12. The <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/publications/claverton-down-campus-map/attachments/university-campus-map.pdf">campus map</a> might be helpful if you get lost.  
</p>

<p>
Bath is a major tourist destination, and offers a huge range of hotels, bed and breakfasts and hostels. A useful website is <a href="https://www.stayinbath.org/">https://www.stayinbath.org/</a>, and the local organisers are happy to offer further recommendations.
