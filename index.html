<h1>
40th British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science<br> & 5th Southern and Midlands Logic Seminar<br> University of Bath, April 4&ndash;5 2024
</h1>

  <p>
The <a href="https://www.bctcs.ac.uk/">British Colloquium for Theoretical Computer Science</a> (BCTCS) is an annual event for UK-based researchers in theoretical computer science. A central aspect of BCTCS is the training of PhD students, providing an environment for students to gain experience in presenting their work, to broaden their outlook on the subject, and to benefit from contact with established researchers. The scope of the colloquium includes all aspects of theoretical computer science, including automata theory, algorithms, complexity theory, semantics, formal methods, concurrency, types, languages and logics.

<p>
A small number of travel bursaries of up to Â£150 will be available to PhD students who do not have alternative sources of funding. These bursaries have been made possible through generous sponsorship from <!--the <a href="https://www.bctcs.ac.uk/">BCTCS</a> and--> the <a href="https://www.blc-logic.org/">British Logic Colloquium</a>.
</p>

<p>
All bursaries have now been allocated.

BCTCS will take place on 4 April and the morning of 5 April, and followed by the Southern and Midlands Logic Seminar on the afternoon of 5 April. Registered participants of BCTCS are free to attend SMLS at no extra charge.
</p>

<p>
We anticipate arrivals from 10:30 on 4 April, which should make it possible for participants from the South-West and London to travel up on the first day without needing overnight accommodation on 3 April.

<h2>
Travel and accommodation
</h2>

<p>
The main campus of the University of Bath is located on a hilltop just outside the city centre. It is within walking distance from Bath Spa train station in principle, but you should allow 30&ndash;40 minutes and be wary that the route involves a steep uphill climb. A more comfortable alternative is to take one of the regular bus connections from the city centre to the campus. Further information on how to get to the university can be found <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/topics/travel-advice/">here</a>, with details of bus routes <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/travelling-by-bus-to-the-university-of-bath/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Talks will take place in the Chancellors' Building rooms 1.12 and 4.1. The <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/publications/claverton-down-campus-map/attachments/university-campus-map.pdf">campus map</a> might be helpful if you get lost.  
</p>

<p>
Bath is a major tourist destination, and offers a huge range of hotels, bed and breakfasts and hostels. A useful website is <a href="https://www.stayinbath.org/">https://www.stayinbath.org/</a>, and the local organisers are happy to offer further recommendations.
